 <h1>CI/CD Project: Continuous Delivery with Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins
Overview</h1> 

<h3>This project establishes a complete CI/CD pipeline, automating the software build, test, and deployment process. By using Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Jenkins as the automation server, the pipeline efficiently manages application deployments with reliability and scalability.
Tech Stack</h3>
<h5>
    GitHub: Code repository, version control, and source for the Jenkinsfile.
    Jenkins: Orchestrates the pipeline by automating tasks such as building, testing, and deploying.
    Maven: Compiles and tests code, manages dependencies, and packages artifacts.
    SonarQube: Ensures code quality through static analysis, detecting vulnerabilities and generating reports.
    Docker Engine: Builds Docker images, allowing the app to run consistently across environments.
    Docker Hub: Serves as a repository for Docker images, making them accessible for deployment.
    Kubernetes Cluster: Provides a robust platform to run and manage containers, ensuring scalability and resilience.
    Helm: Manages Kubernetes deployments, enabling easy deployment and rollback capabilities.

Workflow

    Code Commit (GitHub): Developers push code to the GitHub repository, where changes trigger the Jenkins pipeline.
    Build and Test (Maven): Jenkins runs Maven to build and test the code, ensuring functionality and stability.
    Code Analysis (SonarQube): Jenkins triggers SonarQube to analyze code quality and security.
    Image Build (Docker Engine): After passing tests, Jenkins uses Docker to build a container image of the application.
    Image Push (Docker Hub): The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub, where it's stored for future deployments.
    Deployment (Kubernetes & Helm): Helm deploys the Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster, which manages the app in production.

How to Use

    Clone the Repositories:

    bash

git clone <link to GitHub repos>

Set Up Jenkins:

    Configure Jenkins to pull from the GitHub repository and trigger the Jenkinsfile.
    Set up webhooks for automatic build triggers on commit.

Run the Pipeline:

    The Jenkins pipeline will automatically:
        Build and test with Maven.
        Analyze code with SonarQube.
        Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
        Deploy to Kubernetes using Helm.
